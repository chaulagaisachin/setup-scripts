# Automate LAMP Configuration in a Linux Server
## Bash Script >> script.sh
* This code installs and configures the Apache web server, MySQL database server, and PHP on a Linux system. 
* The Apache web server will serve the PHP content, and the MySQL database server will store data for the PHP applications. 
* Note that this is just an example and may not work on all Linux systems, as it depends on the specific package manager and versions of the software being used.
