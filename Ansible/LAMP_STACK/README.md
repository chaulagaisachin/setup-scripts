## Ansible Playbook >> ansible-LAMP.yaml
* This playbook installs the Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL server packages on the target host, and then configures Apache to listen on the specified port.
* It also starts the Apache and MySQL services, and sets the root password for MySQL.
* To run this playbook, you would need to have Ansible installed on the host where you are running the playbook, and the target host(s) would need to be accessible to the Ansible host.
* You would also need to specify the hostname or IP address of the target host(s) in the hosts field of the playbook, and any necessary authentication information (e.g. SSH keys) to allow Ansible to connect to the target host(s).
* It's important to note that this is just an example Ansible playbook for configuring a LAMP stack, and is not intended to be a complete or production-ready solution.
* The playbook may need to be customized and adapted to fit the specific needs and requirements of your environment.
* For more information on using Ansible, consult the Ansible documentation or consult a knowledgeable DevOps professional.
